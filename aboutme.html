    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Before beginning I would love to introduce myself. I am Hanna Dean and I am currently still in school in high school to be more accurate. I am a hard working student and I also am working on getting a job that will be flexible to my schedule when it comes to school and sports. I have also been working very hard in school in order to go to the college of my dreams FSU. My experiences that have lead me to wanting a job so bad is because in past years I would always have to ask my parents for money to go out with friends or to buy something I really want and I don't want to have to keep taking money from my dad who works very hard everyday just to provide for my family and I but instead I want to work hard so I can make my own money. I also want a job so I can have a sense of what hard work looks like so I am fully prepared to get a job and work after I graduate. I am working toward fulfilling these goals everyday by one working hard in school and maintaining a solid GPA. I am also working hard to find a job that will very well suit me and my busy schedule. I value working with other people and having a healthy work space. I value these in order to succeed because I feel as though when I work with other people who do not cause lots of drama and are fun and friendly then I am able to do a better job rather than be secluded and on my own because then I get bored and distracted very easily. Some short term goals I wish to achieve in the near future is to get all A's and to make the cheer Highschool cheer team. Some fun fact about me is that right now I cheer competitively and also help coach the Tinys that are on my team. I also enjoy being productive in my free time weather that is spending time with friends and family or settling down to read a nice book. I also enjoy watching movies and shows. I would like to be known as a lighthearted friendly person who makes people laugh and smile while also being a hard worker and getting work done on time and  work that is up to par or better than average.</p>
